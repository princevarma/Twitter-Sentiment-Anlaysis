# Twitter-Sentiment-Anlaysis
I made this Project in Juypter Notebook using Data Analysis (in python)

Sentiment Analysis is a technique used in text mining. It may, therefore, be described as a text mining technique for analyzing the underlying sentiment of a text message, i.e., a tweet. 
Twitter sentiment or opinion expressed through it may be positive, negative or neutral. However, no algorithm can give you 100% accuracy or prediction on sentiment analysis.
As a part of Natural Language Processing, algorithms like SVM, Naive Bayes is used in predicting the polarity of the sentence. sentiment analysis of Twitter data 
may also depend upon sentence level and document level.
Methods like, positive and negative words to find on the sentence is however inappropriate, because the flavor of the text block depends a lot on the context. 
This may be done by looking at the POS (Part of Speech) Tagging.
